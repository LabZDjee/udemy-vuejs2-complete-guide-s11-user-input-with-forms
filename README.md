Assignments:

- Create a Signup Form where you retrieve the following Information:
  Full Name (Given Name + Family Name)
  Mail
  Password
  Store Data? Yes/No
- Only display the Form if it has **not** been submitted
  Display the Data Summary **once** the Form HAS been submitted

  which still holds the Given Name and Family Name Input Fields
